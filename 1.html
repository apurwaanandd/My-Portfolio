        <div class="section-content animate-fadeIn">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a dedicated Python programmer and Machine Learning enthusiast currently in my fourth year at Bharati Vidyapeeth University College of Engineering, Pune. I have consistently achieved academic excellence, with a remarkable aggregate CGPA of 9.5. I secured a perfect 10 GPA in my 1st semester and 9.64 GPA in the 6th semester. My passion for technology drives my commitment to continuous learning and growth in my field.

                I have worked on various datasets, applying machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, K-NN etc to enhance accuracy through feature selection, stratified sampling, and ensemble learning techniques. I conducted an in-depth analysis of disease prevalence and gender-based classification. Proficient in python libraries like Panda, Numpy and Scikit-learn.
                
                As a Research Intern at MECON India Ltd, a Government of India Enterprise, I researched security threats posed by quantum computing. I evaluated quantum-resistant algorithms and recommended improvements in access control and encryption, enhancing the security measures within the organization.
                
                I am also a content writer, which allows me to share insights and knowledge on technology and other topics as well, helping today's generation people to stay informed and inspired.
                
                In addition to my technical skills, I serve as a Coordinator in the Training and Placement Department at Bharati Vidyapeeth, College of Engineering, Pune. My career goal is to leverage my skills and education to contribute meaningfully to the tech industry, delivering high-quality technology solutions. I am eager to embrace new challenges and opportunities that foster both personal and professional development.</p>
